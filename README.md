# Turborepo + Next.js + Tailwind + TypeScript + Jest Starter

## Getting started

1. Download https://pnpm.io/ first
2. `pnpm install`
3. `pnpm dev` to run the Next.js development server

This is pretty bare-bones and mostly for my own usage. Feel free to use whatever you find useful here!

## Pendings

There are a bunch of things to do before calling this _done_, feel free to grab something from the issues or open a new one!
